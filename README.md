## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Windows (tested), should work on macOS/Linux with minor font adjustments

### Install and Run from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/N1ckw1ck/ascii-art-generator.git
cd ascii_art_gen

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python ascii_art_src_final.py
```

### Building Executable
```bash
# Make sure venv is activated
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "ASCII_Art_Generator" ascii_art_src_final.py

# Find executable in dist/ folder
```

## üéØ Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Image Processing**: Uses PIL (Pillow) to load and resize images
2. **Character Mapping**: Maps grayscale values to ASCII characters
3. **Font Rendering**: Uses system monospace fonts for consistent character spacing
4. **GUI Framework**: Built with PyQt5 for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Color Preservation**: Maintains original image colors in the ASCII output

### Performance
- **Low Detail**: ~0.1-0.5 seconds for typical images
- **Ultra Detail**: ~1-3 seconds for complex images
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes images in manageable chunks
- **Responsive UI**: Non-blocking interface during processing
